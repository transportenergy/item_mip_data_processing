\usage{
generate_ds_proxy_data(
  pop_data_fn = "downscale/SSP_Population.csv",

}
\arguments{
\item{pop_data_fn}{file name of data with population by scenario, country, year (including future iTEM years)}

\item{gdp_data_fn}{file name of data with GDP by scenario, country, year (including future iTEM years)}

\item{transportenergy_data_t0_fn}{file name of data with transportation energy consumption data by country, for a
base year. May include mode-level detail.}

\item{use_modal_detail}{logical indicating whether to determine mode-specific proxy values. If false, a single proxy
will be calculated for the whole transportation sector.}

\item{apply_modal_elasticities}{logical indicating whether to differentiate income elasticities by mode. If true,
exogenous assumptions are used. If false, all modes are assigned an income elasticity of 1.}

\item{save_output}{indicate whether to save the output of this function}

\item{create_dir}{indicate whether to create a new directory if the specified one does not already exist}

\item{output_dir}{file path where output of this function is saved}
}
\description{
Takes in file paths to country-level data that is used to construct downscaling proxy datasets for any number of
country-level socioeconomic realizations, in all time periods. Input socioeconomic data must include all future
analysis years; these data are used to expand but other proxy data from a given base year to all iTEM analysis years.
Returns a list of downscaling proxy dataframes.
}
\details{
The downscaling proxy data generated by this function are assumed to apply to all models; i.e., elasticities
  linking future GDP growth to future changes in the base-year proxy data do not differ by model.
